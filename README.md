# Learning — Python Mini Projects

This repo is a small collection of **beginner-friendly Python scripts** I wrote while learning the language.  
It includes classic games and simple utilities, all implemented in plain Python with no external dependencies.

## 📂 Contents

- `snake_game/`  
  A simple implementation of the classic **Snake** game.

- `Caeser Cipher.py`  
  Script to **encrypt and decrypt text** using a Caesar cipher with a configurable shift.

- `Password generator.py`  
  Random **password generator** that builds passwords from letters, numbers, and symbols.

- `Student_Count.py`  
  Simple **student counter** script (e.g., tallying counts by group / category).

- `guess number game.py`  
  **Guess-the-number** game where the program picks a number and the user tries to guess it.

- `hangman.py`  
  Console-based **Hangman** word-guessing game.

> Note: Filenames and behavior reflect early learning code; they’re intentionally simple and straightforward.
